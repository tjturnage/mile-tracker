# mile-tracker

This uses a dictionary of days biking miles were logged and how many miles were ridden on those days.
The dictionary gets read into a pandas dataframe and plotted. The top plot is accumulated miles. The
bottom plot is how many miles per day I need to average for the rest of the year to achieve my goal
of 1000 miles.
